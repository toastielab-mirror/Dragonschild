Hi there, it has been a whole month and a lot has changed but we will keep that for a seperate time.

What I am here to talk about today is the current state of Dragon's child studios or as it is currently Dragon's child group, there have been some not so fun things happening lately and I feel it will be best to put this project into hiatus until things can get resoled.

### What is not stopping with this?

The things that are continuing is Toastielab, Valkyriecoms, The EllieBot project and the hosting stuff.

The things that are being paused is the game creation side of things.

I am sorry if this comes as a shock to people I just want us to all take a break and sort out the issues that are currently plaguing us.


Thanks for reading and I am sorry if I have ticked anyone off with this.
