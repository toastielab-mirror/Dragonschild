Hi there, we have some new things to announce that are in the works.

### ValkyrieChat (Shortened to Valkyrie internally)

Valkyrie is a chat platform that we are currently developing since some of our team members have found glitches with how the Discord platform works for them. This plaatform is in early development (it is so early development there is not even an alpha yet)

### Dragon's child forum

Dragon's child forum is a forum setup by myself over the last couple of days as a place where people can ask questions of our team, make suggestions or just hang our and chat among themselves about whatever the team have announced on there e.g. Games, Services and other things, we hope you will take some time to look at our new forum site and say hello.

Thanks for reading this small announcement on this site,

Toastie (Leader/CEO?)
