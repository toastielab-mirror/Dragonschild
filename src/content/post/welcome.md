Hi there, I am Toastie the current leader (or CEO if you wish to refer to me as that) I formed this group or company with one of my good friends [Azrarl Indrason](https://www.twitch.tv/azrarl_indrason) we currently provide server hosting on our site [Dragons child hosting](https://dragonschildhosting.net) as well as a git platform called Toastielab located at https://toastielab.dev and our up and coming social site called Valkyriecoms so I hope you will follow us along on our journey as we grow into what we want to create.

Thanks for reading this post.
Toastie (leader/CEO)
