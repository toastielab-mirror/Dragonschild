#### Here are the core values that our team holds dear.

**Privacy Based:**

We do not like our data being sold so why should we sell your data off to other companies?

**Have fun making games:**

We try to have fun in all that we do. We love games and we love to play them. So why should we make games that are not fun?

**Honesty and transparency:**

If we have any privacy issues we will make sure that they are resolved and that a transparency report is made.
